* **How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**
  * I feel pretty confident so far. It's going to take a bit to memorize the call method names and what they do. The naming convention isn't very intuitive to me.

* **Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**
  * I guess I'm still trying to understand when/how (what situations) we would use these call methods, but I'm sure it'll make more sense later on. Seems like we're just focusing on the building blocks right now.

* **What questions do you have about Arrays?**
  * Just what I mentioned above. For example, what situation would I need to use a "shift" in? Why wouldn't I just remove the first element from the array?
